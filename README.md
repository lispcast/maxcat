# Largest concatenation of integers

If I have a list of integers, I can concatenate their
base-10 strings to get one large integer. However, if I
reorder them, then concatenate them, I could get a larger
integer. The task here is to find the largest integer you
can create by concatenating a given set of integers.

## How to play

Edit the function `maxcat.core/maxcat`. Implement the
function described above.

Run the tests with this command:

```bash
$CMD clj -m kaocha.runner
```

Or you can have them run automatically as you edit the file:

```bash
$CMD clj -m kaocha.runner --watch
```
